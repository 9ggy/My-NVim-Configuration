  9ggy NVim Config

<p align = 'center'>
  This is a collection of my .vim configuration files that I use on NVim. Please note that I don't think this is compatible with vanilla Vim due to some plugins being written in   Lua.

### *Note: The font i am using has some encoding errors, therefore some characters may not show. This may be different for you though.*

  Use this for yourself!

You can use this same config just by cloning this repo into this directory: `~/.config/nvim`
This can be done via this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/9ggy/My-NVim-Configuration.git ~/.config/nvim
```
