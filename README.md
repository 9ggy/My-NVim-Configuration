  9ggy NVim Config
</h1>


<p align = 'center'>
  This is a collection of my .vim configuration files that I use on NVim. Please note that I don't think this is compatible with vanilla Vim due to some plugins being written in   Lua.

You can use this same config just by cloning this repo into this directory: `~/.config/nvim`
This can be done via this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/9ggy/My-NVim-Configuration.git ~/.config/nvim
```

  Utilizing plugins using Plugged
</h3>

<br />

Following this you will need to install the plugin manager 'Plugged' in order to utilize any plugin a have in the `plugins.vim` file.
Here is the link to the Plugged repository; there they will show you how to install the plugin manager: 

After Plugged is installed you need to run `:PlugInstall` in the `~/.config/nvim` directory.

That's it! You can now use my oh so very cool NVim configuration!
